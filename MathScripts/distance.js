// try to remember to use "use strict" in every javascript?...
// formula

let x1 = 1;
let y1 = 2;
let x2 = 4;
let y2 = 6;

let distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow((x2 - x1), 2) + Math.pow((y2 - y1), 2));
// console output

console.log("The distance between (" + x1 + "," + y1 + ") and (" + x2 + "," + y2 + ") is " + distance.toFixed(2));
